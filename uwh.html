    <h4>Chicago Underwater Hockey</h4>
    <div class="row hero-intro">
      <div class="col-lg-9">
        <p class="p-intro">The Chicago Underwater Hockey is a non-profit organization that promotes inclusion and
          diversity in a healthy and social environment. Underwater hockey is a co-ed sport, with players aged 12 to 82.
          Because this sport is played in the water, it’s easy on the joints and helps keep people active and healthy.
          It’s also a great way for people to meet new friends and build relationships. The Chicago UWH team needs to
          acquire new members and increase members retention to keep this 62-year old club alive. The goal with this
          website redesign is to bring awareness to the little-known sport and to encourage Chicago residents to give it
          a
          try. So, let’s dive in!</p>

        <p>Users were disappointed with the limited amount of content on the website. They expected more in-depth
          information about the sport. They were also frustrated with a number of interface issues that made the webiste

            platforms to learn more about the sport and complete the sign-up process. The website presented heuristics
